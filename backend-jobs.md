            <p><strong>This is a fully remote position.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Work on things that matter</strong><strong><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad Hoc is a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people. Our teams use modern, agile methods to design and engineer government systems that connect Veterans with services, bring affordable health care to millions of people, and support important programs like Head Start. And as we work to make critical government services intuitive, accessible, and human-centered, weâre also changing how the government thinks about and uses technology. If you thrive on change, want to help close the gap between consumer expectations and government services, and can see the possibilities in ambiguity, then we want you here with us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What matters most</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad Hoc operates according to our commitment to inclusivity, acceptance, accountability, and humility.

With a generous PTO policy and Slack channels for every interest (from bird watching to space nerds to parenting) our culture embraces the things happening in your life. Maybe you need to adjust your schedule to care for your family or take a bike ride. At Ad Hoc, thatâs embraced.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><em>What youâll do</em></h2><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our ideal Back End Software Engineer knows how to build large-scale production systems in modern agile environments.
