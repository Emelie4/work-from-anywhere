<h2>Why this project?</h2>

<p>My goal with this project is to curate best location independent jobs at one place. <br><br>There are multiple remote job boards out there. But most of the jobs are tied to one location. I am hoping to make this a unique repository of location independent developer related jobs. This repository is updated daily to curate the latest jobs. I only want to curate the best quality jobs that's why I am going to stick with a handful of best remote job boards.</p>

We recognize that the same innovative technologies that may benefit society can also be abused to invade privacy, provide new tools of discrimination, foreclose opportunity and harm individuals and communities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through original research and inclusive engagement, we work to ensure that empirical evidence and respect for human dignity guide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how technology is developed and governed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the Policy Director</strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Policy Director works both internally to coordinate policy engagement opportunities across our research programs, and externally to represent and position our research and researchers to engage with multiple policy-focused communities on emerging technology and society issues. This is a unique role that exists at the intersection of technology, policy, scholarship, and equity, and deeply understands the trade-offs and implications of policy and tech product directions for a range of stakeholders, with a particular focus on addressing the harms data-centric technologies pose to historically vulnerable and marginalized communities.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a strong record of advancing racial and economic justice in your work.&nbsp; Youâve worked alongside or within the ecosystem of technology and policy actorsâcivil society coalitions, policymakers, and tech industry actorsâin the United States and/or Europe, and are positioned to increase the visibility and impact of the Data &amp; Society networkâs research within those communities. You have bridged scholarship and policy communities in the past, and are comfortable with limitations on direct advocacy that Data &amp; Society, as a 501c3 and research institute, adheres to while still contributing to substantive policy design based on research findings. Youâre familiar with the different methods and approaches being developed to govern data-centric systems and the ways in which the emerging evidence base from Data &amp; Society and beyond can inform this. You have experience in balancing opportunistic and proactive opportunities for policy engagement as they emerge. Finally, you are comfortable coordinating and collaborating with colleagues across reporting structures and within project teams to achieve organizational goals.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep understanding of the networks and coalitions in Data &amp; Societyâs spheres of research, and the methods for achieving their policy and advocacy goals;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7â10&nbsp; years of experience in policy or governance environments;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JD, Masters in Public Policy or Administration&nbsp; or policy / legal experience within government, civil society or tech industry;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarity with historical and current scholarship on privacy, surveillance, and the social and political implications of algorithmic decision-making systems, especially as it affects minoritized communities;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working knowledge of some of the debates around key policy issues and statutes in the United States and Europe relating to data governance, such as net neutrality, algorithmic accountability, use of facial recognition by government, Section 230, the CCPA, the GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging national/global AI policies; expertise in one or more of these areas;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong written communication skills; public speaking skills a plus.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Policy Director reports to the Executive Director and works collaboratively with teams across the organization.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Practical Considerations </strong></p><ol><li>This is currently a full-time, remote position in the <strong>Policy Engagement&nbsp;</strong>department.</li><li>Data &amp; Society is based out of New York City, and will for the foreseeable future operate as a remote-first organization.&nbsp;</li><li>While Data &amp; Society is a remote-first organization, there may be some opportunities for travel within the United States to team meetings and other in-person events.

            Itâs not very often that a new asset class is born. But thatâs exactly what weâre witnessing today with the rise of crypto.Over just the last four years, crypto has evolved from an embryonic $50B market to a young-but-growing $2T market today. At Bitwise, we think itâs just getting started. In fact, we believe crypto has reached a turning point, and is headed north of $10T over the next few years. Along the way, we expect there to be risks, pitfalls, and uncertaintyâmuch like there was during the rise of the Web, of cloud computing, and of apps. But we also expect there will be great opportunities, and millions of people wanting to participate in the potential upside.Our goal at Bitwise is to help busy mainstream investors understand and access the opportunities emerging in the cryptocurrency asset class. We want all those who so desire to be able to come along for the ride in a secure and simple manner, and to be able to benefit from the role crypto exposure can play in pursuing their investment objectives.Today is an exciting moment for Bitwise as a firm. We manage over $1B and are growing quickly, with the world's first and largest crypto index fund (ticker: BITW), the first and largest crypto equities ETF (ticker: BITQ), the first and largest DeFi index fund, and many other innovative crypto products. We focus on serving investment professionalsâfinancial advisors, family offices, hedge funds, endowments, foundations, and othersâthe people entrusted to look after the capital and savings of individuals and institutions across the country. We provide education, partnership, and professionally managed investment products tailored to this groupâs needs, to help them build their view, pick their strategy, and get their exposure.Currently, Bitwise is a close-knit team of 60+ professionals. Our backgrounds combine technology expertise with decades of experience in asset management and indexing, coming from firms including BlackRock, Blackstone, Meta, and Google, as well as the U.S. Attorneyâs Office. Weâre backed by some of the most accomplished investors in venture capital and veterans of the financial services world. We love working together, we love what we do, and weâre excited about whatâs ahead.Weâre looking for an exceptional individual to join our team and take on important responsibilities to help Bitwise scale. You will report to the Active Portfolio Manager and will be a key resource in shaping and leading the investment process for Bitwiseâs inaugural active management product. There will be a lot to learn, a huge impact to be had, and some lifelong relationships to be built along the way.Bitwise is an equal opportunity employer.

Youâll be responsible for continually delighting our users with best-in-class thinking tools.</p><p>In addition to Shape Up, we also occasionally roll up our sleeves and do customer support to better understand our users and their needs, regardless of our role within the company.</p><p>Our primary mode of operation is asynchronous. We use real-time communication with great care, and only where it makes sense. We use Whimsical, email, Slack, and Zoom for our day-to-day communication.</p><p>But we also believe in spending quality time together, which is why we try to bring everyone from around the world together at least twice a year for what we call "Whimsical Summits". At Summits we focus on getting to know each other better and building bonds that help us communicate better when we're apart.</p><h3>About Whimsical</h3><p>Whimsical was founded in 2017 by Kaspars Dancis and Steve Schoeffel to help people think and collaborate in the digital-first work environment.</p><p>Whimsical's product is expressive, fast, and delightful. We believe that software should spark joy, not dread.</p><p>We are a remote-first company and big proponents of remote work because it democratizes the opportunities for people everywhere.</p><p>Our operating philosophy is based on set of core principles, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Sustainability:</strong>Â We don't believe in growth at all costs. Growth is a fundamental part of a healthy existence but we want it to be in balance with sustainability and bounded by ethical behavior. We strive to work calm, 40-hour work weeks. Whimsical is also committed to doing our part towardsÂ <a class="external" href="https://whimsical.com/blog/on-the-path-to-sustainability">sustainable future for the planet</a>.</li><li><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong>Â We care deeply about our work. We are specialists, eager learners, and persistent in our pursuit of quality work. We're patient and committed because building great things takes time.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus:</strong>Â We're building Whimsical for the long-haul, not a quick exit. We avoid shortcuts and consider every key decision from a 10+ year perspective.</li><li><strong>Partnership Mindset:</strong>Â Weâve built the company around the idea that everybody who joins us should feel like they are partners in the business. Time is precious and we want Whimsical to be the place where people invest their time rather than sell it. Our equity offers are 100% transparent and above market average. We also pay everyone at the same level the same salary, no matter where they live.</li></ul></div></div>

If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, donât hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahum. Here it comes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Whatâs a Silverfin?</h2><p dir="ltr">At Silverfin weâre trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS weâre automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.</p><p dir="ltr">The good news is weâre succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is thereâs still plenty left to work on, and thatâs where we hope you come in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Whatâs Team Syncs?</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the core features of Silverfin is integration with the bookkeeping software that accountants already work with, in order to import their accounting data. This means we have integrations with over 30 different vendors, and we want to add more as we expand to different markets.</p><p dir="ltr">Team Syncs is one of the teams responsible for creating and maintaining these kind of integrations. The ideal candidate loves working with APIs, including the uncertainty they bring. Some APIs we need to use are poorly designed, badly documented or unreliable, and it can be challenging to build a robust integration. Yet the satisfaction of empowering our customers to import gigabytes of data from their clunky bookkeeping software and to use Silverfin's advanced features makes it all worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">Being a tinkerer and having persistence to solve puzzles will definitely be a plus to face our many challenges due to the plethora of different systems we interact with.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Now letâs give you something to chew on!</em></p><p dir="ltr">Our short-term roadmap will focus on:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Refactoring and improving our own framework (written in Ruby) which is installed on windows machines and consumes our REST API. This process involves accessing raw data on customerâs machines and sometimes doing reverse engineering to collect and transmit the required data.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Building an auto-updater for our system to be able to perform automatic updates of our Ruby client in a timely fashion over more than a thousand remote installations running at our customersâ premises.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Improving our Ruby clientâs performance</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Adding tools to our framework to debug, instrument and log errors.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Longer term we will then focus on:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Refactoring internal data import pipeline. The main goal will be to move from sequential processing to parallel processing to improve syncs speed and stability by cutting through legacy technical debts.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Improving our syncs interacting with 3rd party API to optimise the amount of queries we perform and reduce necessary pressure. Sobriety at itâs finest!</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Implement orchestration when downloading financial documents to improve performance and give our customer better feedback.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Bringing our administration sync pipeline to the next level by integrating technologies only used by our financial pipeline.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?</h2><p dir="ltr">Weâre a remote-first engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than theyâve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel thatâs exactly how it should be.</p><p dir="ltr">Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. Itâs OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids â whatever reason, you donât need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases itâs not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.</p><p dir="ltr">Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We donât shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so thereâs a written, persisted record. Weâre mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slackâs DnD function, especially when youâre not working!</p><p dir="ltr">Weâd be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but itâs not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What does working at Silverfin look like?</h2><p dir="ltr">We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people. In team syncs, however, we almost have no front-end work to do, as most of of our work features do not involve a UI.</p><p dir="ltr">Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. Weâre enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the âother sideâ.</p><p dir="ltr">We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice. Team syncs also owns a Ruby client app that runs on windows servers to interface with local accounting software.</p><p dir="ltr">No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but theyâre free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.</p><p dir="ltr">Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>*: Our ops team noted that this actually isnât that hard to achieve if youâre just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">What does your future look like?</h2><p dir="ltr">Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you donât need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone has a â¬1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday youâll get paid like any normal day.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Requirements</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">You get Rails</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Nice to haveâs</h2><p dir="ltr">These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Donât worry if none of the following applies to you.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Experience in Fintech</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Accounting knowledge</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Knowledge of running Ruby on Windows machines</p></li></ul>
