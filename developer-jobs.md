<div>Hello there! We are Stefan and Tobias, brothers and founders of <a href="https://www.ganzdigital.com">Ganz Digital</a>, and we’re looking for a talented coder to join our team.</div><div><strong><br>We are a tiny startup incubator from Switzerland.</strong></div><div>
<br><br>We help people bring their ideas to life and their products to success. We do this by designing and developing web and mobile apps, creating and running marketing campaigns, and helping our customers to think digitally and execute lean.<br><br>Apart from the projects we realize for our customers, we also have a small number of apps and platforms that we market ourselves.<br><br>The range of our projects spans simple proof-of-concepts, minimum viable products, and full-fledged Software-as-a-Service applications.</div><div><strong><br>You are a talented coder with a feel for aesthetics.</strong></div><div>
<br><br>In your 2 to 5 years of building software, you’ve developed web sites and web apps with <em>ReactJS </em>and <em>TailwindCSS</em>, mobile apps with <em>React Native</em>, and backends with <em>NodeJS</em> and—ideally—<em>Firebase</em>.<br><br>You did all that not just because you like to code but because you like to build software that is being used by people. You care about clarity – in your code as much as in the UI. That’s why you keep things short and simple. <br><br>You know how you work best, when you’re the most productive, and when you need a break. You know how to tackle big tasks, how to deliver on time, and when to let go. You know when to use a quick hack, and when to rewrite a chunk of code to make things easier in the future.<br><br>You are driven, opinionated, quick and thorough. </div><div><strong><br>We offer a ton of freedom and fair pay.</strong></div><div>
<br><br>You will be the driver of the projects you work on, not just a cog in a machine churning out code. We will free the way for you to build great software in the way that works for you. We care about results, not process.<br><br>Everyone at Ganz Digital works fully remote. You can choose where and when you want to work. A full-time job consist of 40 hours of work per week and you can select a workload anywhere between 60% and 100%.<br><br>We pay competitive salaries based on your local economy, and we top it up with an additional monthly allowance for your office and equipment. You also get 25 days of paid vacation per year.</div><div><strong><br>We would love to hear from you.</strong></div><div>
<br><br>Does this sound like a match? Then please fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/T8QGkDEvADizxMZ47">questionnaire</a> (https://forms.gle/Wtay5HHbAWE8rb6QA) and drop us an <a href="mailto:jobs@ganzdigital.com">email</a> with a link to your favorite project in your portfolio.</div>

<strong><br>What will you work on?<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Building and maintaining integrations with accountancy software packages and APIs.</li>
<li>Improving and expanding our on-premise Ruby client which runs on thousands of our customer’s systems.</li>
<li>Designing and building features to make the lives of our system administrators easier, such as an auto-updater and continuous deployment.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>What are we looking for?<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>You’re experienced in both Ruby <em>and</em> Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.</li>
<li>You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls.</li>

<li>You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.</li>
<li>You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally.</li>
<li>You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.</li>
<li>You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.</li>
<li>You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on <a href="mailto:engineering-jobs@silverfin.com">engineering-jobs@silverfin.com</a>.<br><br><em>Ahum. Here it comes.</em>
</div><div>
<strong><br>What’s a Silverfin?<br><br></strong>At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.</div><div>
<strong><br>What’s Team Syncs?<br><br></strong>One of the core features of Silverfin is integration with the bookkeeping software that accountants already work with, in order to import their accounting data. This means we have integrations with over 30 different vendors, and we want to add more as we expand to different markets.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>Team Syncs is one of the teams responsible for creating and maintaining these kind of integrations. The ideal candidate loves working with APIs, including the uncertainty they bring. Some APIs we need to use are poorly designed, badly documented or unreliable, and it can be challenging to build a robust integration. Yet the satisfaction of empowering our customers to import gigabytes of data from their clunky bookkeeping software and to use Silverfin's advanced features makes it all worth it.<br><br>Being a tinkerer and having persistence to solve puzzles will definitely be a plus to face our many challenges due to the plethora of different systems we interact with.<br><br><em>Now let’s give you something to chew on!</em><br><br>Our short-term roadmap will focus on:</div><ul>
<li>Refactoring and improving our own framework (written in Ruby) which is installed on windows machines and consumes our REST API. This process involves accessing raw data on customer’s machines and sometimes doing reverse engineering to collect and transmit the required data.</li>
<li>Building an auto-updater for our system to be able to perform automatic updates of our Ruby client in a timely fashion over more than a thousand remote installations running at our customers’ premises.</li>
<li>Improving our Ruby client’s performance</li>
<li>Adding tools to our framework to debug, instrument and log errors.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>Longer term we will then focus on:</div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>Refactoring internal data import pipeline. The main goal will be to move from sequential processing to parallel processing to improve syncs speed and stability by cutting through legacy technical debts.</li>
<li>Improving our syncs interacting with 3rd party API to optimise the amount of queries we perform and reduce necessary pressure. Sobriety at it’s finest!</li>
<li>Implement orchestration when downloading financial documents to improve performance and give our customer better feedback.</li>
<li>Bringing our administration sync pipeline to the next level by integrating technologies only used by our financial pipeline.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?<br><br></strong>We’re a remote-first engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.</div><div>
<br>Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.<br><br>Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!<br><br>We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>What does working at Silverfin look like?<br><br></strong>We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people. In team syncs, however, we almost have no front-end work to do, as most of of our work features do not involve a UI.</div><div>
<br>Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.<br><br>We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice. Team syncs also owns a Ruby client app that runs on windows servers to interface with local accounting software.<br><br>No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.<br><br>Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.<br><br>*:<em> Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?</em><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>What does your future look like?<br><br></strong>Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.</div><div>
<br>Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day.</div><div><strong><br>Requirements</strong></div><ul>
<li>You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.</li>
<li>You <em>get</em> Rails</li>
<li>Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Nice to have’s<br><br></strong>These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.</div><ul>
<li>Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team</li>
<li>Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring</li>
<li>Experience in Fintech</li>
<li>Accounting knowledge</li>
<li>Knowledge of running Ruby on Windows machines</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Interested?<br><br></strong>You can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 18 July. There’s no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the application questions.</div><ul>

<div>Groove is looking for a very senior full-stack developer to help us accelerate our pursuit of building the best damn customer support tools on the planet. <br><br>You may have heard of us from our <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/top-posts">Journey to 500K blog</a> or from seeing us in places like NY Times, BBC, Forbes, Entrepreneur, Hacker News or elsewhere around the web. <br><br>This gig is not for the unseasoned. We need someone who's been in the trenches and helped grow a B2B SaaS company. A coder and a leader, who can hack with the best of them, and has an appreciation for good design and usability. A craftsman with the fire to help us execute on our product roadmap and move us along on our journey to 10MM in ARR. We've got a tight, scrappy team of former CTOs and founders working to make our app simpler, stronger and better. <br><br>We've put the time into talking with our customers and hitting product/market fit, and and need your help to step on the gas.<br><strong><br>From the technical side, here's what you'll need to know:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Ruby (with and without Rails)  </li>
<li>Expert knowledge of Javascript </li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of React, Redux and GraphQL</li>
<li>Deep understanding of HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Proficient understanding of git</li>
<li>Location: US or EU</li>
</ul><div>Experience working remotely is the only other requirement. You’ll be joining a completely remote team that knows how hackers work best. Meetings are kept to a minimum and everyone is left to get things done. Familiarity with Slack is a plus, and advanced-level Giphy skills will take you far.<br><br>If you’ve helped a fast-moving team win before and are ready to do it again, we want you on board. Our work impacts thousands of businesses around the globe, and we have our sights (very publicly) set on massive growth goals. If you think you can help us get there and are ready to join the family, email us at wewantyou@groovehq.com.<br><br>

It was started back in 2013, and since then we’ve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">level of perfection</strong> where it’s <strong style="background-position: 50% center; background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: inherit;">superior to a micro-service architecture</strong> — despite an ever-increasing number of features.</p>

                <p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://build.a.team/remotivereferral" rel="nofollow">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. </p>
<p style="text-size-adjust: 100%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
