<p style="text-align: justify;"><br><em>Zapier is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though our job description may seem like we're looking for a specific candidate, the role inevitably ends up tailored to the person who applies and joins. Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if you meet these criteria:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About You</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You love code</strong>. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You value collaboration</strong>. You understand that building modern software is a team sport, and you enjoy working as part of a tight-knit team. You’re happy to pitch in and help the team, whether by reviewing code, pairing on a tricky problem, or just thinking about how to solve the challenges we’re facing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can balance lots of concerns</strong>. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, accessibility, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You advocate for the user</strong>. You have a keen eye for great design, and you’re empathetic to the needs of the end user. When you see users struggling to succeed you take it as a personal challenge to understand why and help the team build a better product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You love learning new things</strong>. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Python, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to GraphQL, server-side React rendering and TypeScript typing.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Work with stakeholders (other Zapier teams, or external partners) to understand requirements, propose solutions, and build something to help those stakeholders succeed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Contribute to improving NextJS apps by building reusable React components with modular CSS. Ensure reliable code by leveraging Jest and Cypress tests.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPagetest, or custom tooling.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Refactor or improve existing code as languages, frameworks, or techniques evolve. Help the team pick appropriate tools to solve new problems as they arise.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to help us become a better, more effective organisation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Help teach your colleagues new skills, through code review, discussions and mentoring. Help us all become better engineers and humans.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">As a part of Zapier's <a href="https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fzapier.com%2Flearn%2Fcustomer-support%2Feveryone-on-support%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-hands philosophy</a>, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your growth at Zapier as we believe that each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute in all areas. We encourage collaboration and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist with projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Whole Package</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have a non-standard application process designed to promote inclusion and equity. We first ask a few questions in our application form that would typically be asked at the start of an initial interview. This helps speed up the process and lets us get to know you a bit better right out of the gate. Please be sure to answer each question; the resume and CV fields are optional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After you apply, you are going to hear back from us—even if we don’t see an immediate fit with our team. In fact, throughout the process, we strive to make sure you never go more than seven days without hearing from us.</p>

We're excited to work with talented and empathetic people, and do not discriminate based on race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, genetic information, pregnancy, age, or any other status protected by local law. Our <a href="https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">code of conduct</a> provides a beacon for the kind of company we strive to be, and we celebrate our differences because those differences are what allow us to make a product that serves a global user base.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zapier is committed to inclusion. As part of this commitment, Zapier will ensure that people with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations.
